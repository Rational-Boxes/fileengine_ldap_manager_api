"""Primary/replica failover primitive, shared shape with the bridges and CSAI
(SPECIFICATION.md §1.1).

A lazy circuit-breaker: a failed primary connection trips it for a cooldown,
during which *reads* fall back to the replica; after the cooldown the next
operation re-probes the primary. **Writes never fail over** — they require the
writable master, so a tripped breaker surfaces as a 503 (see LdapClient).
No background threads.
